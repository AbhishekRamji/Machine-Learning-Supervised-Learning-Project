Machine-Learning-Supervised-Learning-Project
The goal of the project is to create a Model to predict if a customer will churn or not, using Python. It covers all the Machine Learning steps starting from collecting data, cleaning the data, performing Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA), creating supervised models and fitting the data, and finally comparing the performance metrics of models created.

The following Supervised Models are covered in this project: 1)Logistic Regression 2)K Nearest Neighbor 3)Decision Tree 4)Random Forest 5)Boosted Trees
